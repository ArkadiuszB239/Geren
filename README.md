# Geren - project for learning purposes

Main goal of this project is improve as a developer. 
Use new technologies, write some (at leas try to) clean code and have fun :P

For now the main subject of this application is to get data from Google Calendar,
store it somewhere e.g. database and send sms notification base on it.

# Why?

Because I needed some goal to achieve, something simple yet doing something.
Funny story, I heard that my barber is manually sending SMS reminders to customers every morning.
They keep their schedules in Google Calendar, so I thought: 
> I have my goal

Maybe one day he will use this application. Who knows... :)

I invite you for my journey with this project. I will try to keep adding new ideas and 
keep expanding this project. From time to time in case of adding some new technologies or 
doing significant changes I will add new version of this application.
